                        Before few years when NIDHI and Family were at cross-road, they were confused about whether to continue the engineering or to choose the passion of fashion designing.
                        As a numerologist I assessed her birth chart and told her to choose Fashion designing and predicted that her 24 age and 2016 would be her turning point.
                        Now , in 2016 she had showcased her designs at london fashion week.

                        Itâ€™s a proud moment as a Numerologist when your prediction come true.
